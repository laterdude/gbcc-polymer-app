Initial Polymer 1.0 SPA for the Great Basin Coordination Center, includes basic layout elements and neon animations.

Utilized polymer 1.0 starter-kit-light's demo-app to create initial app structure.

Page.js routing will be implemented once the desired routing configuration scheme has been finalized.

Do not run bower update, some native polymer elements have been customized, custom elements have yet to be properly configured.
